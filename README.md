# imageViewer
I've only just started programming in Java so things will certainly not be perfect. Suggestions (for better coding) are welcome.
This will be an image viewer for a sports club. It will display an image for a certain amount of time.
Each club can upload on or more images to their own subdirectory.
The program will loop through each subdirectory and display the images from each subdirectory, one image from one subdirectory at a time.
Each club will get the same amount of images displayed, for instance, if one club uploads only one image and another club uploads two images the
program will show the one image twice and the two images once.
More functionality such as display time, adjust image size to screen size, selecte image formats to show... will be added in due time.

It is a work in progress, I can only work on it for a few hours on weekends so be patient.
